Hey! Dude, what's up?  
I'd say if you want to learn something *"fresh"*, you should look [**elsewhere**](https://github.com/OverrideStudio/StandardBLT/). For example [**here**](https://github.com/OverrideStudio/StandardBLT/tree/1.18.2_Fabric/), and [**here**](https://github.com/OverrideStudio/StandardBLT/tree/1.12.2_Forge/). It's just a **simple** GitHub Pages site, ~~not even ReadMe.md is updated (in legacy)~~, **nothing fancy**.

Just it.
